👋🏽 Hi, I'm Alejandro! I'm a UI Developer focused on creating accessible and intuitive interfaces, where the user experience is the main focus.

I'm interested in web standards; without them, there wouldn't be a solid foundation for evolution.

## A little about me 📝

I was born in Argentina. I began my professional journey in IT support for companies, some of which were government-related.

When I moved to Spain in 2017, I changed my career to web development, where there is constant growth and there is always an objective on the horizon that motivates me to keep learning.
